Yhc Erlang Backend: proof of concept experiments

This directory contains a demonstration program which was translated from Yhc Core
to Erlang Core, and further to BEAM loadable format. To run the demonstrations, start
an Erlang shell (erl) in this directory.

The program (Test1.hs) features the following demonstrations:

1. Simple factorial calculation. To run, type in shell:

1> hserl:force(hs_test1:fac(5)).
120

2. Two (finite) lists merged together:

2> hserl:hslist(hs_test1:fuse({'@lst', "ABCDE"}, {'@lst', "123"})).
"A1B2C3DE"

3. Ping-Pong program: starts 2 processes which send each other messages:

3> hserl:force(hs_test1:main(5)).                                  
Main: Starting ping-pong 5 times
